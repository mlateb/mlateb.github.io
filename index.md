Hi! I'm Mustapha Lateb.
===
   
Graduated, both, in **Ecology** and in **Geoinformation**. My research is mainly on Landcover change and forest fire mapping using satellite Remote Sensing and GIS.    
  
I like to investigate new Image Processing, Machine Learning, Statistics, Timeseries Analysis techniques.  
   
I preferably use Open Source solutions (e.g. Python geospatial libraries, QGIS, Bash, Git, SQL, HTML, CSS).   
   
I work as **Researcher** at *Mediterranean Agronomic Institute of Chania* [MAICh](https://www.iamc.ciheam.org/) and **PhD student** at *Mouloud Mammeri University of Tizi-Ouzou* [UMMTO](http://www.ummto.dz/).   
   
I'm from Tizi-Ouzou, Algeria. I spent most of the last six years in Chania, Greece. For more informations see my [Curriculum Vitae](/about/).
