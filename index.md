Hi! I'm Mustapha Lateb.   
===
   
Graduated, both, in **Environment** and in **Geoinformation**. My research is mainly on Landcover change and forest fire mapping using satellite Remote Sensing and GIS.    
  
Fan of **Data science**, I like to investigate new Image Processing, Machine Learning, Statistics and Timeseries Analysis techniques.  
   
My most used tools are Python and its Geospatial libraries, QGIS, Bash, SQL, HTML, CSS and Git.   
   
I work as **Researcher** at *Mediterranean Agronomic Institute of Chania* [MAICh](https://www.iamc.ciheam.org/) and **Doctoral candidate** at *Mouloud Mammeri University of Tizi-Ouzou* [UMMTO](http://www.ummto.dz/).   
   
I'm from Tizi-Ouzou, Algeria. Between 2013 and 2019, lived mostly in Chania, Greece. For more informations see my [Curriculum Vitae](/about/).
