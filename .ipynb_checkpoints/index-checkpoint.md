Hi! I'm Mustapha Lateb.   
===
   
Graduated, both, in **Environment** and in **Geoinformation**. My research is mainly on Landcover change and forest fire mapping using satellite Remote Sensing and GIS.    
  
Fan of **Data science**, I like to investigate new Image Processing, Machine Learning, Statistics and Timeseries Analysis techniques.  
   
My most used tools are Python and its Geospatial libraries, QGIS, Bash, SQL and Git.   
   
I'm from Tizi-Ouzou, Algeria. Between 2013 and 2019, I lived mostly in Chania, Greece. For more informations see my **Curriculum Vitae** in [HTML](/resume/index.html), [PDF](/resume/mlateb_cv_en.pdf) or [ODT](/resume/mlateb_cv_en.odt).
